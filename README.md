data-structures
=============

This code is free to use and abuse as you like - I dont care if you use it for monetory gain, in your project or otherwise. This is an example implmenetation of commonly used data structures in computer science courses commonly taught under "Algorithms and Data Structures". Motivation for this is to make it easy for students learning computer science OR for those preparing for job interviews to have some example references of implmentation.

For people utilizing this to learn, I recommend downloading the code and re-writing some of the core functions yourself for practice. Software is never learnt by just looking at examples, its learnt by writing software yourself.

Download and Executing (on a bash prompt)
============
I assume you have gcc, and make installed. If not, get them.
```
$ git clone https://github.com/ashishbajaj99/data-structures
$ cd data-structures
$ make
$ ./test-example linked-list
$ ./test-example bst
$ ./test-example linked-list bst avl-tree
```

File Structure and Code

TBD
